The web
Collection of HTML documents
HyperLinks (Links)
Invented early 1990’s 
30 Billion Documents 

Major Pieces of the Web
You, Your Computer + Browser,  HTTP, The internet and Servers

HTML
Hypertext Markup Language

Made up of:

•	Text Content
•	Markup (what it looks like)
•	References to other documents (e.g. Images and videos)
•	Links to other pages

www.udacity.com/html_playground (jsfiddle.net/WW3bh/)

HTML Markup
<Name> Contents </NAME>   (This is referred to as a tag or the element)
Opening Tag	      Closing Tag (Has slash in front of it.)

HTML Attributes
<Tag ATTR=”Value”>contents</tag>

Anchor Tag <a>– anchors are for creating links.
href is the attribute name

<a href=”www.reddit.com”>derp</a>

<a href=”www.udacity.com”>my favorite</a>

Image Tag
<img> - images
<img src=”url” alt= “text”>
The alt= “text” is used if the link is broken.
This is a void tag.

Whitespace
Text on multiple lines
<Br> break
It is also a void tag

Another way to do a line break is to use the <P> Paragraph tag. This is not a void tag.
<P> content</P>

The <p> needs to appear for both chunks of text that make up a paragraph:
<p>Hello everyone!</p> <p>We're using two lines now!</P>

With the <br> tag extra spaces don’t render.
Why do we have a <br> and a <p> tag. <br> is inline. The <p> is block.
The <br> works like a return.
The <p> tag actually creates a text box.

So far the elements we have learned break down as:

Inline elements: <br> <em> <img> <a> <span> <strong>
Block:	<p> <div> <form>

Span/Div
Span is inline
Div is block

They both contain their content.

SUMMARY
First, recall the two main topics covered in this lesson.
Overview of the Internet: You were shown the big-picture view of how the internet works and were introduced to terms like servers, browsers, the internet, and HTTP.
Introduction to HTML: You were introduced to HTML tags (like <b>, <p>, and <em>) and saw how even though these tags aren't visible to users of a web page, they still carry meaning that ismeaningful to web browsers.
These topics were covered quickly and it's okay if you forget a lot of the details. But there are a few points which you should keep with you.
What to take away from this lesson.
The five most important things to take from this lesson are the following:

1 - What a Web Page is
A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
________________________________________
2 - How Coding Works
Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
look like this:
I'm learning to code!
________________________________________
3 - Computers are Stupid
Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").
For example, if you forget to close a <b> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.
________________________________________
4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything
There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.

5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary
You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (<p> for example) and a closing tag, (</p>). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the <br> tag).
Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write <a href="www.udacity.com">
    
    
    
    
    
  </body>
</html>
